The Ticket Booking Chatbot App is an intelligent conversational assistant that helps users search, check availability, and book tickets seamlessly. Built with Dialogflow for natural language understanding and integrated with a MySQL database, the chatbot can fetch ticket costs, provide real-time responses, and guide users through the booking process.

This project demonstrates the integration of chatbot technology with a database-driven backend, making it a practical solution for ticket booking systems in events, travel, and entertainment industries.
